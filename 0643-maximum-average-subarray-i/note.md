- Precomputes the sum of the first k elements, then slides the window by adding the new element and subtracting the one that falls out.

## While

- This solution uses the sliding window pattern to find the maximum average of a fixed-size subarray.
  While not strictly necessary here, it's a good way to practice a versatile technique for more complex problems.
